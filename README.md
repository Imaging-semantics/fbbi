# Welcome to fbbi

_Warning:_ This is not (currently) the official home of the fbbi biological imaging methods ontology.  The contents of this repository should be considered entirely experimental. If you want the current master version of this ontology please visit the [image / fbbi obofoundry page](http://www.obofoundry.org/cgi-bin/detail.cgi?id=image).

To date, fbbi has been entirely the work of [FlyBase](http://www.flybase.net) and the [cell image library](http://www.cellimagelibrary.org/), who have both used it extensively to annotate images on their respective sites.  Please credit them if you use this ontology.

Future usage and development may involve [PhenoImageShare](https://github.com/PhenoImageShare) and [Virtual Fly Brain](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain).
