# Biological imaging methods ontology

This ontology was originally developed by FlyBase (http://www.flybase.net) and extended by the [cell image library](http://www.cellimagelibrary.org/), who have both used it extensively to annotate images on their respective sites.  Please credit them if you use this ontology.

It has also been used by [PhenoImageShare](https://github.com/PhenoImageShare), [Virtual Fly Brain](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain) and in metadata for the [Human Cell Atlas](https://github.com/human_cell_atlas)
